Hosted site and (currently bare-bones) homepage of the club.

## TL;DR.

We're a direct democracy hoping to bring industry skills into the doors of Hunter.

But we don't want to stop there. We want to...

* help you build a rich industry-facing skill set
* learn about development tools to make your life easier
* get you into a Top-N company (tech interviews, winning projects)

That's the promise of the club, but we need you to make it happen.
