Hosted site and (currently bare-bones) homepage of the club.

## TL;DR.

Everyone knows that it's good to have open source projects on your resume, and we know it's hard to build a complete project at a hackathon and flesh it out. Heck, we know it's hard to even organize a team to go to a hackathon when everyone has different academic contraints.

That's where OSC comes in. We're a direct democracy hoping to bring industry skills into the doors of Hunter. We hope to give you a platform, help them find a team, and help you see your projects through completion. 

But we don't want to stop there. We want to...

* help you build a rich industry-facing skill set
* learn about development tools to make your life easier
* get you into a Top-N company (tech interviews, winning projects)

That's the promise of the club, but we need you to make it happen.
